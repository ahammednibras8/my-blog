## Strategic Choices
Every decision below serves the single goal of maximum performance with minimum maintenance (ZeroOps).

1. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** This is the core decision. Content is rendered to pure HTML/CSS at build-time. Result? **Instant load times, automatic SEO benefits, and zero runtime server cost or surprises.**
2. **Multi-Zone Architecture:** Utilizing Next.js's ability to map this blog to a subdirectory (```/blog```) of the main portfolio domain (```ahammednibras.is-a.dev```). **This creates a unified, seamless user experience without requiring a monolithic codebase or complex routing at the Edge.**
3. **Minimal Architecture:** The site is structurally simple (Index + Single Post View). This keeps the code clean, focused, and highly maintainable. **No bloated "cool tech" for the sake of complexity**.
4. **Stack (Next.js + React):** Next.js handles routing and the SSG build process. React allows for clean component definition. **No extra abstractions; pure, practical, scalable code.**
5. **Content Workflow (Markdown):** Posts are simple Markdown files decoupled from the application logic. This maximizes **Content Velocity**â€”writing the story is the only bottleneck.
6. **Hosting (Vercel):** Optimized for Next.js SSG builds. Deployment is a Git push process that leverages a global CDN for distribution. **Reliable ZeroOps deployment, fully integrated with Multi-Zone setup.**
